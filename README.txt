Serenity Castle
A DOOM2 WAD by Lawrence Candilas.


It's 2020.  Hell yes, I still play DOOM, though these days it's always a GZDoom variant with mouselook and jump enabled, and usually with the Brutal Doom mod installed, and also on one of the enhanced difficulty levels.

Thanks for checking out this WAD.

== The journey ==

I have been a fan of DOOM since the original in the early 90's.  I was too poor to have a PC at that time (to be fair they were expensive then), and had to settle for checking DOOM out on friends computers.  That is, until DOOM came out for the Super Nintendo.  Yes, it was pixelated as hell, but the gameplay was mostly there, the music was incredible, and I spent so many hours playing it.  Did the same for the Playstation version when that came out.

In the early 2000's I somehow got a program called WADED, and experimented with creating WADs, using the original DOOM.EXE and DOOM2.EXE to test.  I still have those couple WADs somewhere and I ought to find them and complete them sometime.  

But years later, I discovered DOOM source ports, then the wonderful ZDoom and GZDoom, and then very wonderful BRTUAL DOOM mod.

I've known about Doom Builder for a while, and a few months ago, decided to install Doom Builder 2 again, learn how it works and actually complete something in my life.



== About this WAD ==

When playing the original DOOM over 20 years ago, the little glimpses outside captivated me.  It made me wonder just how big you could make a level and how expansive it could be.  After learning that the F_SKY1 texture is really a a fake ceiling, and that in reality all DOOM levels are techincally "inside", my innocence was shattered and I went into a deep depression for a few hours.

So to reclaim my mental health, I started this WAD with a huge square, one corner at -8192,-8192 and the other at 8192,8192.  I then wanted to make some sort of castle, because everyone likes castles, so I started in the middle.  I wanted mountains and lakes to surround the castle, so I did that too.  Then blood.  This is DOOM, so there has to be blood.  Everything evolved from there.

Therefore ... this WAD is very large.  Very large might be an understatment--it's huge!  

Sorry, I went a little overboard with decorating the interior of the castle, and also with the rocky mountains.  
Overall, this map is designed to be fun and shouldn't torture the player too much with impossible battles, impossible secrets, or aesthetic challenges.  There's a lot of enemies in this map and you will be assaulted from ALL SIDES at various places in the map; but ammunition is plentiful and everywhere if you look for it.

I tried really hard to not make it boring.  It's heavy on the action and while your path through the castle will not be straightforward, things aren't too puzzling.  You may need to figure out a switch or two, and two switches in the map will appear to do nothing immediately but will definitely help you later.  So press every switch you find.



== What Can Play This WAD ==

Development was done using:

 - An AMD Athlon dual-core PC with 6GB of RAM
 - Windows 10
 - Doom Builder 2
 - SLADE 3
 - GZDoom version g1.8.2 with no mods

Performance during extensive testing was good.  Framerate drops a little bit at certain points.  On a modern system things should be perfect.

This level was created with ZDoom's mouselook in mind. There's a lot of places where enemies are far above the player and you'll have the most fun with a DOOM port that's fully 3-D.

This level was also created with the Brutal DOOM mod in mind, but it's not required to play.  On my development system framerate took a hit, and there were severe framerate drops when many burning barrels and gore parts are on screen, but it was decently playable.

Since the PC I used to develop this on is fairly old, most players on modern hardware should experience no problems as long as they are using a standard x86-based PC on Windows.

If you want that old-old-school feeling, the only DOS program I tested--using DOSBox--that could run this successfully is BOOM.  The original DOOM2.EXE crashes with a visplane error almost instantly.  



== Hints ==


- Look behind boxes.

- There are no Cyberdemons or Spider Masterminds in this WAD.

- If you get overwhelmed with monsters at certain points, keep moving and come back later to kill everything if you're trying to get 100% kills.

- Explore the mountains for soul spheres.  You will probably need every one.

- Walking over pools of water in the castle opens doors or lowers platforms.

- You'll visit the large middle room twice.  You'll have a second opportunity to kill all the monsters there.

- There's a way to turn the light on in the really dark storeroom.

- Watch out for crushers.  There's one and it may surprise you.

- The Baron of Hell block, if touched, will lower a platform, and you'll find it useful.

- After you exit the castle, head to the right towards the lake to get the BFG.  You don't want to pass it up.

- There's an Arachnotron on top of a switch.  Finding and pressing this switch will help you greatly later.
